Hilton later attacked, kidnapped, and held her captive for three days before murdering her with a car jack handle. A trained martial artist, Emerson fiercely resisted, prompting Hilton to remark, \"She wouldn’t stop fighting\" (Licavoli, Greenbelly). Initially, Hilton targeted her for money, but his actions were ultimately driven by mental instability and sociopathic tendencies.",
